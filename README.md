This emoji does not express loud happiness. Instead, it embodies a quiet joy such as it has a soft smile, and its eyes are closed. This is some sort of happiness that doesn't bring attention. It doesn't have the enthusiasm like other emojis. Since it doesn't have an exaggerated face, it shows that the emoji is calm and subtly emotional, but in a positive way. The quiet sparkle suggests that it has a gentle kind of happiness. Therefore, it resists using bright colours or big shapes; they are small and light-coloured to show that they are calm. Overall, this quiet joy emoji is designed to show that kind of happiness and joy doesn't always have to be loud and dramatic. It can sometimes be joyful when you are calm.

This code uses variables, loops to create different shapes, such as circles and squares, randomly on a canvas by having each shape have a randomly chosen size and colour. Every tenth shape includes the text "This is my second mini project" to make this project better and add creativity. This shows how to use let() to declare a variable and random() to randomise the shapes' output. As well as the if statements to change the shapes and output the text.

This system uses a grid and repeated shape to show the structured but different dynamics of day-to-day digital interaction. The grid itself, referred to from Rosalind Krauss's analysis, represents fixed scaffolding that underlies digital life. But through the conditional variation of stroke, fill, and form, the system introduces some disruptions by showing how repeated digital movements are never perfectly identical but are  changed through the emotion.

The multiple grids with different visual features, such as colour and transparency, link to Nicole Sylvia's concept of the grid as space for tension. The design therefore shows to picture the rhythm of the repetition.

This shows the visual meaning of media through its pixels and sound. Inspired by digital repetition and nostalgic signals, I used a static image and looping radio static to remind me of a fading broadcast. The pixel process showed how the structure can divide the memory, and the interactive sound loop highlighted engagement in media. I discovered that even small elements, such as colour blocks and the static hum, can suggest complex emotional textures. This experiment helped me understand more about how repetition shapes our insight into media.
