This code uses variables, loops to create different shapes such as circles and squares randomly on a canvas by having each shape having a randomly chosen size and colour. Every tenth shape includes the text "This is my second mini project" to make this project better and adds the creativity. This shows how to use let() to declare a variable and random() to randomise the shapes outputed. As well as the if statements to change the shapes and output the text.
